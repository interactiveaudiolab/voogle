# vocalsearch
This is code for an audio search engine that uses vocal imitations of the desired sound

The microphone request for access, recording, and wav file generation is handled by code from Record.js, a JavaScript plugin for recording/exporting the output of Web Audio API nodes. It is licensed under the MIT license.

The plugin can be found here: https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs
